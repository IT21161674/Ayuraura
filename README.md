# AYURAURA

Stress is a pervasive issue in modern society, adversely impacting mental and physical health.  
Traditional stress management approaches, such as lifestyle changes and pharmaceutical treatments, often face challenges related to long-term sustainability and accessibility.  

Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine, provides a holistic method for managing stress by harmonizing the body, mind, and spirit through creative activities.  
Despite its potential, Ayurveda is underutilized due to limited practitioner availability, accessibility issues, and skepticism about its scientific basis.  

**AyurAura** addresses these challenges by merging Ayurvedic principles with advanced AI-driven biometric analysis.  
This innovative app delivers personalized stress relief recommendations based on biometric data from users' eyes and breathing patterns, complemented by The Perceived Stress Scale.  

By providing tailored activity plans directly to users via smartphones, AyurAura overcomes the scarcity of Ayurvedic practitioners and ensures broader accessibility.  
The app’s AI capabilities enhance the accuracy of stress assessments, thereby increasing user trust through scientific validation.
