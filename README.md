Stress is a pervasive issue in modern society, adversely impacting mental and physical health. 
Traditional stress management approaches, such as lifestyle changes and pharmaceutical treatments, often face challenges related to long-term sustainability and accessibility. 
Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine, provides a holistic method for managing stress by harmonizing the body, mind, and spirit through creative activities. 
Despite its potential, Ayurveda is underutilized due to limited practitioner availability, accessibility issues, and skepticism about its scientific basis. AyurAura addresses these challenges by merging Ayurvedic principles with advanced AI-driven biometric analysis. 
This innovative app delivers personalized stress relief recommendations based on biometric data from users' eyes and breathing patterns, complemented by The Perceived Stress Scale. 
By providing tailored activity plans directly to users via smartphones, AyurAura overcomes the scarcity of Ayurvedic practitioners and ensures broader accessibility. 
The appâ€™s AI capabilities enhance the accuracy of stress assessments, thereby increasing user trust through scientific validation. 
AyurAura offers a broad range of non-pharmaceutical therapies, including art therapy with mandalas and personalized raga music therapy, designed to cater to individual needs and enrich the stress management experience through creative and cultural practices. 
It also incorporates predictive analytics to forecast future stress based on behavioral patterns, helping users anticipate and manage stress proactively. 
Key features include a dynamic progress tracker with daily updates on mood and energy levels, visually engaging charts, and personalized feedback to refine stress reduction strategies. 
An AI-driven chatbot provides continuous motivation and practical advice, supporting users in their journey toward improved stress management. 
In summary, AyurAura combines AI-driven biometric analysis with Ayurvedic principles to offer a holistic, accessible, and scientifically validated approach to long-term stress management and well-being.
